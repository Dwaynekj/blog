## Process

I'm happy to meet you and help you as much as I can to understand if it makes sense for us to work together. I'm happy to help you find the right person if I'm not the right fit.

What I do will after meeting is write up a proposal [Sitatuational Assessment](./assessment.md)

- Pin down objectives, metrics, and the benefits you hope to capture
- If you know _exactly_ what you need, you’re better off with someone else:
