Build strong fundamentals in building searching systems and improve your RAG systems. I've refined these over 8 years of machine learning engineering and AI consulting. This course will equip you with the skills to:

- Build robust processes for identifying system bottlenecks
- Significantly enhance your probabilistic systems
- Implement advanced RAG techniques for real-world applications

Don't miss this opportunity to transform your RAG capabilities and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving field of applied AI.

### Week 1: RAG System Foundations

- Learn the RAG System Inference Flywheel
- Create evaluation methods, with user and synthetic data 
- Explore data representations and fine-tuning to improve search quality

### Week 2: Query Processing

- Implement query segmentation identify areas of improvement
- Apply classification and clustering techniques to detect drift and be data driven in your approach
- Understanding my framework on inventory and capability planning

### Week 3: Multi-Index Search and Routing

- Build multiple search indices
- Create strategies for various content types
- Design query routing systems

### Week 4: RAG Product Design

- Build user-focused RAG products
- Design UIs for feedback collection
- Develop strategies for user satisfaction

## What You'll Gain

- Establish robust evaluation pipelines
- Implement advanced classification systems
- Optimize multi-index search strategies
- Design intuitive, feedback-rich user interfaces
