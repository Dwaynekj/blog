# Things

In the past 2 decades I went from sharing a bed with my parents renting out the unfinished basement of some canadian family to doing quite a bit better for myself. This is all the stuff I did, plan to do, and plan on doing more of next year. I'll include some of my general thoughts on the stuff I've been using.

## Sleep

I really miss my own bed after traveling so much, but I've always stuck with a Purple Mattress (the brand). Everyone's going for 8 Sleep, but I don't want to shell out for a subscription just to sleep. For better sleep, I love using [Nasal Strips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XF91NZ4) to help me breathe easier. I'm not into mouth taping yet... You can also get allergen-proof bedding to keep dust mites at bay! Now that I have long hair, I use [silk pillowcases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7GRYXLS). You can block light from doors with [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D4QHRC7W?th=1) and use [blackout blinds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MZLSMHM). For travel, I swear by the [Manta Sleep eye mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask). They even have versions for hot and cold, which I really love.

I've been working on building better morning habits - getting outside first thing for coffee and sunlight exposure. I'm also trying to eat dinner earlier in the evening. Still working on reducing my pre-bedtime screen time, but taking it one step at a time.

## Air Quality 

Large part of my poor sleep comes from my allergies and air quality and light, so its useful to get [monitor](https://www.airgradient.com/) and an [air purifiter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01728NLRG/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) and humidifier during the winter.

## Personal Care

I usually shower with just water, but recently I've started using some skincare products. One of my favorites is the [CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7HHKH3G), a lightweight moisturizer with ceramides and hyaluronic acid. After a week of using it, I've received compliments on my skin. For supplements, I take [NAD+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK5K5TQ) and [Tongkat Ali](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TTDFXFV) to support my overall hormone health.

As a luxury item, I love using [Aesop's Reverence hand wash](https://www.aesop.com/us/p/body/hand/reverence-aromatique-hand-wash/). It is exfoliating and has a wonderful scent. For perfume, I always wear [Hinoki from Monocle](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/everything-else/product/comme-des-garcons-parfums/monocle-edition-scent-one-hinoki-eau-de-toilette-50-ml/6659441) which is a woody mossy scent inspired my kyoto.

I also plan to start using [retinol](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D2C4Q4/ref=ewc_pr_img_4?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) for some better skin.

I plan to suppliment some other stuff in the future, Collagen peptides, fish oil, magnesium, glucosamine & chondroitin, electrolyte protocols.  


Here's what these ingredients do and their key benefits:

- **Retinol**: A form of Vitamin A that helps skin cells renew faster. Benefits include reducing wrinkles, fading dark spots, and improving skin texture by stimulating collagen production.

- **Ceramides**: Natural fats that act like "mortar" between skin cells. Benefits include strengthening skin barrier, preventing moisture loss, and protecting against environmental damage.

- **NAD+**: A coenzyme vital for cellular energy production. Benefits include improved energy levels, better cellular repair, and potential anti-aging effects as it supports mitochondrial function.

- **Tongkat Ali**: An herbsal supplement from Southeast Asia. Benefits include increased energy and muscle strength, improved mood, and better hormone balance, particularly testosterone levels.

- **Collagen Peptides**: A protein supplement derived from collagen. Benefits include improved skin elasticity, stronger nails, and healthier hair.

- **Fish Oil**: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Benefits include improved brain function, reduced inflammation, and better heart health.

- **Magnesium**: A mineral essential for muscle and nerve function. Benefits include improved energy levels, better sleep, and reduced stress.

- **Glucosamine & Chondroitin**: Supplements for joint health. Benefits include reduced joint pain, improved mobility, and better cartilage health.

## Hair Care

Now that I have long, permed hair, moisture retention is key to my hair care routine. I use [Milbon Curl Mousse](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086JTYR1G) as my primary styling product to keep my curls hydrated and defined. I'm planning to expand my routine with hair oils and invest in a high-quality [Mason Pearson brush](https://www.amazon.com/Mason-Pearson-Popular-Mixture-Bristle/dp/B001N444JK).

**The Science Behind Perms and Moisture**

Perms chemically break and reform hair's natural bonds into curls, making hair more porous. This means:

- Hair absorbs moisture quickly but also loses it fast
- Regular hydration is crucial to maintain curl pattern
- Without moisture, permed hair becomes straight, frizzy and brittle

## Audio

relatively speeking my tech is pretty basic, I use a macbook pro and a iphone. I use a very accessable [record player from audio technica](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3S4X3P) and some basic [edifier speakers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088685QVJ). I also connect an amazon echo to my wifi and use it as a speaker by connecting to my [Harman Kardon Aura Studio 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086FS4BSV) which i think is the single best speaker i've ever owned, perfect for hosting parties too.

I'd love to level up my audio setup, but I'm not sure what I'd use it for. 

## Office

I dont have strong opinions on office equipment. I use the Embody chair from [Herman Miller](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/) and a [Kinesis Advantage 360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/) keyboard. I have an Eames lounge chair and ottoman from [Eames Office](https://www.eamesoffice.com/products/lounge-chair-and-ottoman).

I will say im pretty happy to with multiple [charging stations](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN8C3MDQ) Where are can charge multiple batter packs that you can take on the go!


## Ergonomics & Eye Health

I've found that ergonomics and eye health are super important, especially since I spend so much time at my computer. Here's what I've learned:

**Ergonomics Basics:**
- Your body will tell you when something's wrong - listen to it
- Investing in good equipment pays off (hence the Herman Miller and Kinesis choices)
- Movement is key - I try to shift positions throughout the day
- Proper monitor height makes a huge difference (eyes should align with top third)


## Lighting

Passive ambient lighting is key, i use a philips hue lights and [noguchi lamps](https://shop.noguchi.org/collections/akari-light-sculptures) they are pricy but i love them.

> It's funny how a simple switch from ceiling-mounted lights to the soft scatter of floor lamps can transform your home from "just another workspace" into a cozy cave of creativity.

## Storage

I use a lot of [muji storage](https://www.muji.us/collections/storage-organizers?srsltid=AfmBOoqMRarrbP1eRCeWDj_Qx6XfFzLqcCSFLNUw7R7_76XsnNbxAQTL) My grail will always be USM Haller storage. but thats a long term investment.

## Traveling

While travling, I adore [rimowa](https://www.rimowa.com) with a few [amazon packing cubes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014VBI5MS).

I genuinely hate traveling, but I've found a few nicer things that make it a bit more bearable. This is where i also use the [manta sleep mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask). Also bring your hydrating face and hair products cause the air is so dry.

## Fashion

If you're a tech bro, please consider a nice pair of leather boots. Get them resoled right after you buy them. I've been wearing my [wyatt harness boots](https://www.ysl.com/en-us/pr/wyatt-harness-boots-in-smooth-leather-810162485.html) for years and they are still in great shape. A nice [cargo pant](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/nanamica/khaki-straight-cut-cargo-pants/16372621). Made from CORDURA is nice. [Ten Thousand](https://www.tenthousand.com/) is a great brand for shirts. 

If you want to know my favorite brand, it's actually [Yohji Yamamoto](https://www.theshopyohjiyamamoto.com/). Let me tell you a little bit about him:

His signature style combines Japanese design with European techniques, focusing on innovative draping and materials. His work emphasizes movement and space through asymmetrical cuts and a predominantly black palette, influenced by watching his mother work with fabrics in their small shop.

The trick is to find a couple good brands that work for your body type and then stick with them as you learn more about your body and proportions.

## Services

I'm trying to constantly buy my time back. The first person I'd hire would be an EA, then cleaners, then a chef. I'm still looking for a meal prep chef who could come to my house and cook for me once a week.

- **Laundry & Cleaning Service:** Save time, maintain tidy space.  
- **Massage Therapy (bi-monthly):** Stay loose, reduce stress.  
- **Concierge Medical & Personal Chef (optional):** Focus on lean body goals, specialized care.  
- **EA Support:** Manage appointments, organize travel, optimize your calendar.
