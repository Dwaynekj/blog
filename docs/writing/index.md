# Writings 

I endeavor to write. It is my weakest muscle, one deprived of many years of neglect. Expect to find pieces on software, open source, personal work, and AI (specifically Multimodal Computer Vison and Inverse Graphics). Also a foreword on AI. Yes, I am a machine learning engineer by trade, but I value human authencity. My writings will surely be grammatically corrected and edited by AI tools but it will fundamentally be my writing. I also intend to write my blog posts piece-meal (think Discord slow mode). I like to iteratively grow this content as opposed to dishing out a large piece fully ready, SEO be damned.
