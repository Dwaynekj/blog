# Public Baths

Last summer I spent a couple of months in Japan traveling around and one of the things I really loved was bathhouses. You know for the first time in a long time I had not gone to a public baths.

## American Zoos

Thankfully the first time I ever bathed naked in a bath house was in Koreatown, LA. I'd never grown up doing sports and so I thought the idea of taking all your clothes off in a bunch of dudes was so, so strange. Luckily everything was fine and funny enough it was the first time in my life I realized that I had a really reasonable body.

But when I moved to New York City and started going to the bathhouses in Brooklyn, everything felt weird. It was like a nightclub. Everyone's body felt like it was made to be looked at and not enjoyed. And it honestly left me pretty confused.

I feel like I've always seen a bathhouse as a place to get together and relax and rest and release the cumulative work that we've all collected as a group of people. The group works together and relax together. But when I look at American bath houses, it just feels like it's another workout.

## Onsen

Outside of my experience in the Korea town bathhouse, most of the time I have been spent was in American ones where the public bathing was against. I felt too optimized and felt more like work and recovery rather than relaxation.

I want to contrast this with my time in Japan where the hotels I visited all had an onsen in one sense or another. It would be something that we go to after we travel in order to relax and recover from the flight or the train ride or the walk over. We are all expected to bathe and sit down and look in a mirror and clean ourselves. And we see the elders teaching the children how to maintain their hygiene and the ritual of the bath house.

And we would just get in the water and be outside and feel the wind and listen to the trees and birds and insects of the summertime. In the onsen, there was a collective calm, that makes it a place where you can go and write poetry about the appreciation of nature. Afterward, they would give you a cold little milk and you could go downstairs and grab a bowl of curry or udon instead.
