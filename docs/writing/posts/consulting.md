# What I Learned from Indie Consulting

!!! note "Fragments"

    This is just a note to the reader that I like to write in a fragmented style using speech to text so if you see any errors or don't really understand what's going on feel free to just contribute and edit or leave a question on the github repo.

I specify indie consulting as something that is completely and wholly separate from the big-time consulting we hear about from those ridiculous institutions. Check out this video roasting [McKinsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiOUojVd6xQ) From John Oliver to understand how I feel about many of these folks. Theres another great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZE0j_WCRvI).

!!! warning "The failure of big time consulting"

    The difference between Indie Consulting and Big Time Consulting as I define it can be captured in one simple idea. Something that Steve Jobs once talked about:

    > "I don't think there's anything inherently evil in consulting. I think that without owning something over an extended period of time, like a few years, where one has a chance to take responsibility for one's recommendations, where one has to see one's recommendations through all action stages and accumulate scar tissue for the mistakes and pick oneself up off the ground and dust oneself off, one learns a fraction of what one can. Coming in and making recommendations and not owning the results, not owning the implementation, I think is a fraction of the value and a fraction of the opportunity to learn and get better."

I strongly believe that if you're a young person you should not be consulted. You should join a big company or a small company and just eat shit and develop the scar tissue that develops over time.

!!! note "Confidence is the memory of success"

    Most of my training did not come from obtaining a PhD. Instead, it primarily stems from my 2 years worth of experience at 7 internships, Academia like NYU Epidemiology and Public Health all the way up to Facebook, And companies that worked on marketing and sales and machine learning throughout the way, building up to my 5-year tenure at Stitch Fix.

    I've managed machine learning projects that have spanned at least two or three years. From collecting the data, to data labeling, to deployments of models, of monitoring those models, of active learning to improve those models. I worked on the data science teams to prioritize both the features and the model development. I work closely with VPs and PMs to plan and determine the roadmap. I've worked with the infrastructure teams to optimize system performance through caching and measured the revenue impact of these latency changes.

    Realizing the need to scale myself, I developed a framework that started with just 100 lines of code but eventually became the driving force behind the recommendations for nearly every pipeline at Stitch Fix. I witnessed the success and longevity of the abstractions I created, as well as identified and addressed any mistakes.

    It's through all these experiences where I've witnessed the consequences of my decisions over many many years that has given me the confidence to know that I can actually help somebody, to improve their condition.

## Why I started consulting

The TL;DR is that in 2021 I had a pretty serious career threatening hand injury. I effectively got tendonitis in both my hands and can't code it as much. And so I took a year and a half off to unwind and I'm slowly ramping up again. Consulting for me offers a much more flexible lifestyle where I can wind up and wind down the hours depending on how I feel. Without worrying that I'm going to go back to working 80 hours a week and messing up my hands again.

## Break down

1. I'm going to first try to define what value is, and use that as a framework to justify everything that we do afterwards.
2. I'll give an example of what I did 10 years ago
3. How I now think about clients
4. Why I think creating content is very important to market and provide value
5. What I actually do after the first call with a client

## What is value?

This is actually completely stolen from Alex Hormozi:

![Value](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UjbG0yU6M8KO43kgdMcsDQ.png)

1. Dream outcome: What is the dream outcome that you want to achieve?
2. Perceived likelihood of success: How likely do you think it is that you will achieve this outcome?
3. Perceived time to success: How long do you think it will take to achieve this outcome?
4. Perceived difficulty of success: How difficult do you think it will be to achieve this outcome?

All of this breaks down into how much someone is willing to pay as a function of how much value you bring to the company. Everything you do must contribute to increasing or decreasing some of these variables. If you can figure out how every single action you take as a consultant can contribute to one of these four outcomes, you'll be able to give value.

!!! note "Stop offering to work for free"

I know a lot of people in my DMs offering to work for me for free. But what they realize is that working for free is not good enough because they actually provide no value.

1. Dream outcome: You have not shown me that you understand what my dream outcome is, and so you have no way of capturing what exactly it is I want.
2. Perceived likelihood of success: You have not shown me that you have the skills to actually achieve this outcome.
3. Perceived time to success: You have not shown me that you can do this in a timely manner. If anything, if you work for free, I have no faith that I can even control or manage your time.
4. Perceived difficulty of success: More often than not, I need help because I do not have enough time. There's a good chance it might take you 8 hours to do something I could do in 1 hour, and instead now I'm stuck reviewing your work and trying to clarify something, wasting even more of my time.

### Personal anecdote from 10 years ago

While, I formally just started an LLC in November of 2023. I would say my first few clients came in 2016. I had a bunch of friends who were Thiel fellows and starting their companies and they would often come to me to ask me for advice. At that point I'd already been very deep in a lot of machine learning and data science applications and spent thousands of hours reading papers over the years. I often worked for free or for dinner or every once in a while a couple hundred dollars on venmo.

I didn't have much to offer except the knowledge I had built up, later I realised that I provided value on was **decreasing the perceived time to success**. I had already done thousands of hours of research. And if you would have spent 30 minutes to ask me a question, I could give you an answer that might take you a week to figure out. That was it. I was just saving them time.

!!! note "Value of time saved"

    Imagine my buddy had a researcher that he paid $120,000 a year for, and I was also making $120,000 a year. If that call was 30 minutes, it cost me $30 of 'my time'. But if the answer to his question took his researcher one week to get to, that's $2,300 of his capital he was deploying. So if I could save him $2,300 by spending 30 minutes of my time, that's a pretty good deal for them! I only charged a 1% commission!

    Given that most realtors charge 6%, with that rate, I could have charged $240 an hour for that 30 minute call.

    The lesson here isn't necessarily how much you should charge, but just understanding that when you talk to those who are allocating capital, the exchange rates work differently.

## Who are you selling to?

I was very lucky that most of the people I worked with were directly the CEO and the CTO. Thank you. Over the past 10 years, the majority of folks have always been a founder who reached out to me first through my network.

Of the large times I failed to make a sale, it had always been the case that I did not understand who the true buyer was. Sometimes it would be a PM or a data scientist reaching out for my help. I would get into long calls and provide value in the form of advice, tactics, or other content that I had created before. Only to send out a proposal, which I'll talk about later, and be told "I'll present this to my boss and get back to you.". I would never hear back, the deal would fall through, and I would be left wondering what happened.

## Give Everything Away for Free

This section could effectively also be titled... Social Media. Obviously, as we get more followers, there's an aspect of social proof that is undeniable. Once you have a larger audience, you have more eyes. And if you have eyes, you can monetize and convert them into customers.

Here's the general structure of making content:

1. Hook: What is the problem that you're trying to solve?
2. Retain: What is the story that you're going to tell to solve this problem?
3. Reward: What is the reward for reading this content?

The hook should be something that foreshadows the reward, and the reward should again address one of those four things in the value equation. All you have to do then is to produce content that is aligned with those four things.

### Checklist

When creating content, ask yourself these things:

- Does my hook foreshadow one of the four things in the value equation?
- Does my story improve the likelihood of success in delivering the 'value'?
- Does my reward actually address something that is valuable to the reader?

By consistently producing content that helps them accomplish their dream outcome, improves the likelihood of their success, decreases the time it takes, and decreases the perceived effort it takes, they will have already gotten value. If you can consistently deliver on those four key things in your content, then the beginning conversations become much easier because they've already gotten that value. You have become less of a commodity where you trade money for time and more like a brand or a luxury good because the perception they have of you has already increased based on the value you've already generated.

One of my most popular blog posts, [RAG is more than embeddings](./rag.md), has been something that over a dozen companies have reached out to me about.

### Hungry People

Hormozi also has a really great comment on how important it is to sell to hungry people.

> If you want to make the most money selling hot dogs, what should you focus on? Is it a better bun? Or a better grill? Or a better sausage? No. To make the most money selling hot dogs, you should just position your stand in front of the stadium right after the baseball game.

One of the things I do now is also just really ask myself how hungry this client is. Are they a new seed company that just raised money (full, a bit bloated)? Or are they needing to find someone to make a prototype that they need in order to raise the seed money to begin with? You can imagine that if the dream outcome was to raise money, the value is different. There's definitely a skill in identifying how hungry the customer is. Since you're in the world of consulting, revenue is always a great way of measuring things. If they're losing a bunch of money or have a payday in the distant future, again, we can use the value equation to figure out exactly how to get there.

If you are trading your time to build them a prototype, you're likely just charging an hourly rate. But if you can confidently look them in the eye and say, "What we build together today will close a $5 million seed round in the next three months, and I can help you get there," it's a completely different story.

## First Call (Sales?)

The job of the first call is to identify which variables we can capture value on. The first thing we should do ahead of the conversation is to understand what their dream outcome is. Then we just have to demonstrate that we can reduce the effort, reduce the time, and increase the likelihood of success. If you've done enough work in stuff like content creation, then it's very easy. They've probably found you because the content that has already delivered some value. And one of my favorite things to do personally is to always share two or three blog posts that I've written that address the concerns they've mentioned during our call. Again, helping for free.

I also try to make a good attempt at guessing exactly what their outcomes are and guessing the problems they run into to highlight my expertise. For example, one of the best things you can do is guess one of their problems and then tell them the solution right away. Usually, if the response is something like, "Oh yeah, we've been thinking about this for a couple of months now and we arrived at the same conclusion," then what you've been able to do effectively is to show that you understand the dream outcome and could have reduced the time to success.

## The situational assessment

Single-handedly the biggest piece of my own practice. The situational assessment is an opportunity for me to effectively highlight and showcase everything I know about the business. Demonstrate that I understand what the dream outcome is (reduce churn, improve performance, etc), and offer up methodology to get it done. One of these things can take two or three hours, but I find it extremely valuable for myself and as a tool for sales.

I'll give an example if what I wrote [here](../../assessment.md). This is taken from Alan Weiss, and I've been able to implemented this with great success, heres some of his [examples](https://www.alanweiss.com/wp-content/uploads/Sample%20Proposals.pdf).

### Structure of the Proposal

- Situation: What is the current situation?
- Objectives: What are the desired outcomes?
- Values: Frame it in terms of the value equation.
- Metrics: How do we measure success?
- Timing
- Terms and conditions

Some callouts:

- Metrics: If it's a struggle to measure success, it'll be hard to identify value and charge for it. You're likely looking at milestones and implementation, which results in trading time for money, rather than execution for results.

- Situation: This is actually just hard, and you need to listen well and develop a skill in appraising the client's situation.

## Some stuff I've learned so far

### Time for money vs capital allocator

The more high-level the client, the more I realized that they think in terms of capital allocation. They are not trading time for money; they are trading capital for time. And so, the exchange rate is different. Just like minimizing the time to success is important. If you can really capture the value of what you do, you'll likely always be charging too little. If you believe that you can actually drive a business outcome, for example, increase $100K ARR in 3 months, then you should be charging a percentage of that. It could be a deal if we see it as simply spending money to make money. Realy companies are throwing around so much capital in hopes of improving talent, their revenue, their product, their valuation.

### Niche Down

You should niche down sooner rather than later. In the beginning, I was just trying to help anybody. Startups, I considered banks, I did technical writing, dev rel, application development, and more. However, the more specific your positioning is, the sharper your message is, and the more likely you are to be able to capture value.

Lack of focus is fun, but context switching is expensive. I made 40k working with 4-5 clients, but I could easily achieve the same with fewer clients and charging more if they were more focused efforts.

I've now drilled down my niche to be around the thesis that 'RAG applications are shitty recommendation systems and I can bring years of experience to help you build a better one.'

Now I focus on working with experienced founders who have raised a series A and are looking to build a RAG application and make at least 500k. They are prequalified based on 'hunger' and to benefit from what someone can bring to the value equation, rather than hiring a contractor as form of labor arbitrage.

### Scaling Out

These days, there are a few ways to scale your business. While I'm choosing not to, I cannot properly comment on this. I do recognize that there are a couple of ways to scale your business: by building a product or by productizing your own knowledge, or scaling out with labor. Here are my thoughts:

1. Product: Unless we are niched down to a specific industry and build a product that serves that industry, it's going to be hard to build a product that makes sense. I'm not interested in productizing [instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor).

2. Knowledge: This is probably closest to what I would do. You can imagine writing a book or giving out food content as a way of marketing my own services and increasing my value, or producing educational content with a partner. I can definitely imagine selling a $15 PDF or some video series if it made sense. But as a function of recurring revenue, it's not worth what I can make. This is probably in line with the [Reagon Beta Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-beta_paradox), but I think in the long run, a book of my consulting experience could make sense.

3. Services: Since my goal is to only work about 25 to 30 hours a week, it doesn't make any sense to come around here and take on more responsibility.

### Thought leadership

Hate to say it, but it works. You just gotta provide substance. Long-form articles will get fewer views than your 300k-view dumb tweets. However, the biggest revelation for me was how often I would share my blog posts after first calls as a "look, I've thought about this problem before." Also, these blog posts are frequently recirculated in the Slack channels of the companies I work with. It's a great way to build trust and demonstrate expertise.

Most of my presence is now in long-form content:

- Instructor Blog: [https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/blog/](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/blog/)
- This Blog: [https://jxnl.github.io/blog/](https://jxnl.github.io/blog/)

If they get the value, I don't think most people care where it comes from. But you have to make sure there's enough identity attached that this is 'something I read that Jason wrote', vs 'something I saw on Medium', that light brand attachment is pretty valuable. You can give the knowledge away for free but keep the implementation paywalled. Obviously, talk to your clients and make sure IP is protected for any definition. But I think it's a great way to build trust and demonstrate expertise, especially if this is how they found out about you in the first place.

## Things I've Not Figured Out

- Pricing is still challenging, especially for educational content that has different leverage mechanics.
- Increasing prices is easy since asking is easy, but I'm reaching a point where pricing might be a function of demand.
- I don't have an exit plan. Unless I end up joining OpenAI, there's no opportunity to sell the company to someone else at a multiple. While that's not the goal, it's something to think about.
- Outreach: I do zero outreach as a function of my public speaking or content creation. It's important to remember that you have to eat what you kill. I'm pretty stable right now, but I definitely acknowledge it as another 'leverage' point that I can improve on.

## Conclusion

Alot of this post is really about understanding and define what value is, and pricing against that. The situational assessment is something that communicates your understanding what is valueable, and presenting a plan to capture that. All of your content creation and marketing should be focused on delivering value in one of the 4 ways:

1. Dream outcome
2. Perceived likelihood of success
3. Perceived time to success
4. Perceived difficulty of success

If your content addresses one, great, if it addresses two, even better. If it addresses all four, you're golden. If you can demonstrate that you can deliver on those four things... You're winning.
