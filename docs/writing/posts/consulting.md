# Indie Consulting

!!! note "Fragments"

    This is just a note to the reader that I like to write in a fragmented style using speech to text so if you see any errors or don't really understand what's going on feel free to just contribute and edit or leave a question on the github repo.

I specify indie consulting as something that is completely and wholly separate from the big-time consulting we hear about from those ridiculous institutions. Check out this video roasting [McKinsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiOUojVd6xQ) From John Oliver to understand how I feel about many of these folks. Theres another great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZE0j_WCRvI).

!!! warning "The failure of big time consulting"

    The difference between Indie Consulting and Big Time Consulting as I define it can be captured in one simple idea. Something that Steve Jobs once talked about:

    > "I don't think there's anything inherently evil in consulting. I think that without owning something over an extended period of time, like a few years, where one has a chance to take responsibility for one's recommendations, where one has to see one's recommendations through all action stages and accumulate scar tissue for the mistakes and pick oneself up off the ground and dust oneself off, one learns a fraction of what one can. Coming in and making recommendations and not owning the results, not owning the implementation, I think is a fraction of the value and a fraction of the opportunity to learn and get better."

I strongly believe that if you're a young person you should not be consulted. You should join a big company or a small company in each shit. And the shit that you eat is the scar tissue that develops over time.

!!! note "Confidence is the memory of success"

    Most of my training did not come from obtaining a PhD. Instead, it primarily stems from my 2 years worth of experience at 7 internships, Academia like NYU Epidemiology and Public Health all the way up to Facebook, And companies that worked on marketing and sales and machine learning throughout the way, building up to my 5-year tenure at Stitch Fix.

    I've managed machine learning projects that have spanned at least two or three years. From collecting the data, to data labeling, to deployments of models, of monitoring those models, of active learning to improve those models. I worked on the data science teams to prioritize both the features and the model development. I work closely with VPs and PMs to plan and determine the roadmap. I've worked with the infrastructure teams to optimize system performance through caching and measured the revenue impact of these latency changes.

    Realizing the need to scale myself, I developed a framework that started with just 100 lines of code but eventually became the driving force behind the recommendations for nearly every pipeline at Stitch Fix. I witnessed the success and longevity of the abstractions I created, as well as identified and addressed any mistakes.

    It's through all these experiences where I've witnessed the consequences of my decisions over many many years that has given me the confidence to know that I can actually help somebody, to improve their condition.

## Why I started consulting

The TL;DR is that in 2021 I had a pretty serious career threatening hand injury. I effectively got tendonitis in both my hands and can't code it as much. And so I took a year and a half off to unwind and I'm slowly ramping up again. Consulting for me offers a much more flexible lifestyle where I can wind up and wind down the hours depending on how I feel. Without worrying that I'm going to go back to working 80 hours a week and messing up my hands again.

## Break down

1. I'm going to first try to define what value is, and use that as a framework to justify everything that we do afterwards.
2. I'll give an example of what I did 10 years ago
3. How I now think about clients
4. Why I think creating content is very important to market and provide value
5. What I actually do after the first call with a client

## What is value?

This is actually completely stolen from Alex Hormozi:

![Value](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UjbG0yU6M8KO43kgdMcsDQ.png)

1. Dream outcome: What is the dream outcome that you want to achieve?
2. Perceived likelihood of success: How likely do you think it is that you will achieve this outcome?
3. Perceived time to success: How long do you think it will take to achieve this outcome?
4. Perceived difficulty of success: How difficult do you think it will be to achieve this outcome?

All of this breaks down into how much someone is willing to pay as a function of how much value you bring to the company. Everything you do must contribute to increasing or decreasing some of these variables. If you can figure out how every single action you take as a consultant can contribute to one of these four outcomes, you'll be able to give value.

!!! note "Stop offering to work for free"

I know a lot of people in my DMs offering to work for me for free. But what they realize is that working for free is not good enough because they actually provide no value.

1. Dream outcome: You have not shown me that you understand what my dream outcome is, and so you have no way of capturing what exactly it is I want.
2. Perceived likelihood of success: You have not shown me that you have the skills to actually achieve this outcome.
3. Perceived time to success: You have not shown me that you can do this in a timely manner. If anything, if you work for free, I have no faith that I can even control or manage your time.
4. Perceived difficulty of success: More often than not, I need help because I do not have enough time. There's a good chance it might take you 8 hours to do something I could do in 1 hour, and instead now I'm stuck reviewing your work and trying to clarify something, wasting even more of my time.

### Personal anecdote from 10 years ago

While, I formally just started an LLC in November of 2023. I would say my first few clients came in 2016. I had a bunch of friends who were Thiel fellows and starting their companies and they would often come to me to ask me for advice. At that point I'd already been very deep in a lot of machine learning and data science applications and spent thousands of hours reading papers over the years. I often worked for free or for dinner or every once in a while a couple hundred dollars on venmo.

I didn't have much to offer except the knowledge I had built up, later I realised that I provided value on was **decreasing the perceived time to success**. I had already done thousands of hours of research. And if you would have spent 30 minutes to ask me a question, I could give you an answer that might take you a week to figure out. That was it. I was just saving them time.

!!! note "Value of time saved"

    Imagine my buddy had a researcher that he paid $120,000 a year for, and I was also making $120,000 a year. If that call was 30 minutes, it cost me $30 of 'my time'. But if the answer to his question took his researcher one week to get to, that's $2,300 of his capital he was deploying. So if I could save him $2,300 by spending 30 minutes of my time, that's a pretty good deal for them! I only charged a 1% commission!

    Given that most realtors charge 6%, with that rate, I could have charged $240 an hour for that 30 minute call.

    The lesson here isn't necessarily how much you should charge, but just understanding that when you talk to those who are allocating capital, the exchange rates work differently.

## Who are you selling to?

I was very lucky that most of the people I worked with were directly the CEO and the CTO. Thank you. Over the past 10 years, the majority of folks have always been a founder who reached out to me first through my network.

Of the large times I failed to make a sale, it had always been the case that I did not understand who the true buyer was. Sometimes it would be a PM or a data scientist reaching out for my help. I would get into long calls and provide value in the form of advice, tactics, or other content that I had created before. Only to send out a proposal, which I'll talk about later, and be told "I'll present this to my boss and get back to you.". I would never hear back, the deal would fall through, and I would be left wondering what happened.

## Give Everything Away for Free

This section could effectively also be titled... Social Media. Obviously, as we get more followers, there's an aspect of social proof that is undeniable. Once you have a larger audience, you have more eyes. And if you have eyes, you can monetize and convert them into customers.

Here's the general structure of making content:

1. Hook: What is the problem that you're trying to solve?
2. Retain: What is the story that you're going to tell to solve this problem?
3. Reward: What is the reward for reading this content?

The hook should be something that foreshadows the reward, and the reward should again address one of those four things in the value equation. All you have to do then is to produce content that is aligned with those four things.

### Checklist

When creating content, ask yourself these things:

- Does my hook foreshadow one of the four things in the value equation?
- Does my story improve the likelihood of success in delivering the 'value'?
- Does my reward actually address something that is valuable to the reader?

By consistently producing content that helps them accomplish their dream outcome, improves the likelihood of their success, decreases the time it takes, and decreases the perceived effort it takes, they will have already gotten value. If you can consistently deliver on those four key things in your content, then the beginning conversations become much easier because they've already gotten that value. You have become less of a commodity where you trade money for time and more like a brand or a luxury good because the perception they have of you has already increased based on the value you've already generated.

One of my most popular blog posts, [RAG is more than embeddings](./rag.md), has been something that over a dozen companies have reached out to me about.

### Hungry People

Hormozi also has a really great comment on how important it is to sell to hungry people.

> If you want to make the most money selling hot dogs, what should you focus on? Is it a better bun? Or a better grill? Or a better sausage? No. To make the most money selling hot dogs, you should just position your stand in front of the stadium right after the baseball game.

One of the things I do now is also just really ask myself how hungry this client is. Are they a new seed company that just raised money (full, a bit bloated)? Or are they needing to find someone to make a prototype that they need in order to raise the seed money to begin with? You can imagine that if the dream outcome was to raise money, the value is different. There's definitely a skill in identifying how hungry the customer is. Since you're in the world of consulting, revenue is always a great way of measuring things. If they're losing a bunch of money or have a payday in the distant future, again, we can use the value equation to figure out exactly how to get there.

If you are trading your time to build them a prototype, you're likely just charging an hourly rate. But if you can confidently look them in the eye and say, "What we build together today will close a $5 million seed round in the next three months, and I can help you get there," it's a completely different story.

## First Call (Sales?)

The job of the first call is to identify which variables we can capture value on. The first thing we should do ahead of the conversation is to understand what their dream outcome is. Then we just have to demonstrate that we can reduce the effort, reduce the time, and increase the likelihood of success. If you've done enough work in stuff like content creation, then it's very easy. They've probably found you because the content that has already delivered some value. And one of my favorite things to do personally is to always share two or three blog posts that I've written that address the concerns they've mentioned during our call. Again, helping for free.

I also try to make a good attempt at guessing exactly what their outcomes are and guessing the problems they run into to highlight my expertise. For example, one of the best things you can do is guess one of their problems and then tell them the solution right away. Usually, if the response is something like, "Oh yeah, we've been thinking about this for a couple of months now and we arrived at the same conclusion," then what you've been able to do effectively is to show that you understand the dream outcome and could have reduced the time to success.

## The situational assessment

This is single-handedly the biggest piece of my own practice. One of these things can take two or three hours, but I find it extremely valuable. It's actually this document that makes me feel like I don't charge enough because so far everyone has accepted the highest offer, And I don't simply have enough time to sell to do this well.

The situational assessment is an opportunity for me to effectively highlight and showcase everything I know about the business. Show them that I understand what the dream outcome is. Understand what the dream outcome is (reduce churn, improve performance, etc)

_TODO: Loose notes for myself:_

## You're probably not charging enough

_TODO: Loose notes for myself:_: Honestly, everyone has chosen my most expensive option, so I probably just need to charge more.

## Niche Down

_TODO: Loose notes for myself:_: I basically think the more you can niche down the more success you'll have. The TLDR is that if you say you can work for everybody, you kind of work well for nobody. And I try to be more and more specific with what I'm actually doing. For example, I can work with experienced operators that have a business with more than 1 million dollars ARR. It's a lot easier to provide value in that than a pre-seed company. Unless the dream outcome here is that I actually help you raise the money. There, I'm leveraging my network in VC or whatnot to get that done. Along with my... More fractional CTO... Style work. I still try to avoid implementation these days.

## The future

_TODO: Loose notes for myself:_: I think the only way to scale more is to just give out more free content and consistently demonstrate the fact that I can build our value. I will write more blog posts, do some educational content, and do some more writing. Another way to make revenue is to build a product. I've got other product ideas in my learning, in which case I just do education for senior folks, or give workshops, write a book, or I can build a product, one that might supplement the consulting business. Right now what I do is I develop instructor and use that as a... In some ways a league magnet. If I can tailor the content to solving specific problems that companies have, they might see that and see that I'm available. I could do a lot more.
