# üëãüèæ

This is my second go at blogging. The last time I tried, blogger.com was one of the most popular blogging platforms around and MySpace was still the leading social media platform. Wow, being a millenial doesn't feel young anymore.


## "Finding my voice"

  I'll still figuring out what I'll share here versus my [newsletter](https://newsletter.dwaynekj.dev/subscribe) but I feel happy to be writing again for myself


## Thanking the Open Source Community

He doesn't know me, but thanks to [Jason Liu](https://x.com/jxnlco) for sharing his blog structure. This is a fork of his blog; I'm going to make it my own over time but as always the Open Source Community rocks!
