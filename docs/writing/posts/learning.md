After writing my post [advice for young people](./advice.md), couple of people asked about my learning process.I could discuss overcoming plateaus or developing mastery, learning for the joy of it. I could also talk about how to avoid feeling overwhelmed by new topics and break them down into smaller pieces. However, I think that has been done before.

Instead, I decided to do something I found interesting: a chronological order description of the things I learned about learning. And how I learned them. I hope this will be useful for people who are interested in how I built out the skill of learning.

## Environments Matter

When I was a kid, both my mom and dad worked two jobs, and no one was at home. But every Saturday, my mom would take the time to walk me to the library, where I would borrow 10 books. I was only allowed to use the computer for an hour a day and watch 30 minutes of television per week, basically just one cartoon. Learning became my escape. I wanted to acquire knowledge and understand physics, such as igneous rocks and metamorphic ones. I also learned about different types of dinosaurs and animals. It covered a wide range of topics, making school, especially STEM courses, easier for me. I was always ahead of the class. In Chinese culture, education is seen as the only way to escape poverty.

Your environment is incredibly important, and from a young age, the act of learning itself became my source of entertainment. This was definitely a consequence of my environment. Although it may seem obvious, I believe it's worth mentioning.

## Don't study things you'll be taught

One of the first realizations I made when I was a kid was that if I went to advanced math or science school. That those 4 years would be wasted as I'd only get maybe 1 extra credit in college. It didn't feel like a great exchange rate, so I decide to enroll an art program instead of a high school stem program.

I figured it would make my life more interesting overall on it did. I learned how to do animation, 3d modeling, art history, I made films, graphic design, websites, flash animations all bunch of stuff.

Having a diverse set of skills is incredibly useful. And eventually you'll get to the point where you can combine them in interesting ways.

### You just need to be ahead a little bit

What are the first realization I made was if I just spent the first week working two or three times harder than everyone else to learn a new piece of software like adobe, Photoshop or illustrator. I would be ahead of everyone else I could spend most of the class answering questions for other people. They built up my self-esteem made me feel smart more than that. It allowed me to get even more reps in. Even if both of us didn't understand what was going on the fact that they could've asked me a question that I didn't know the answer to, and I could figure out faster than them meant that I got to have the rep of learning to do it and teaching is basically two reps. This just dramatically why in the gap between me and everyone else. And very quickly you wouldn't have to work harder, as their learning, and helping others simply gave you access to road blocks you wouldn't have otherwise had.

### Practice is All There Is

I was never the best artist, and I don't think that was the goal. But I want to emphasize one thing: my most skilled friends were always drawing and practicing. To this day, there are people I know whom I have never seen without a sketchbook. They probably fill 12 to 15 sketchbooks every year. It's always amusing when people admire their work and call them talented, unaware that for the past 12 years, every time I've been late for a coffee, every time we've visited a gallery, every time we've gone for a walk, they have always been drawing.

### Understanding Creativity

One of the most important skills I learned in art school is public speaking. Every semester, we had to do an art history presentation and a cumulative presentation representing our thesis work. One of the formative presentations I made was about creativity and the abundance of multidisciplinary artists compared to scientists. My conclusion was that active creativity stems from starting something new. It is relatively easy for those in the creative industry to change fields, such as transitioning from being a painter to a filmmaker or a furniture designer. However, this is not the case in the sciences. If you look at Nobel laureates, most of them received the prize for work they did in their late 20s and early 30s. At that point, they had acquired enough tools to explore the world but not enough knowledge to limit what they believed was possible.

This is why I constantly change what I do. There is no better way to foster creativity than to embrace uncertainty about what is possible. It is akin to being like a baby, constantly probing the world. By doing this constant shifting into new fields, I'm never truely in a place where my belief in my own abilities limits what I think is possible.

### School is not for learning

I also want to note here that I don't think school is for learning. Because if the goal is to learn, I think homeschooling, particularly good homeschooling, outperforms most public schools. However, it is important to realize that homeschooling carries the risk of underdeveloped social skills. This can be confusing and disorienting for high schoolers, but I believe we see this in full force in college.

## You don't have to specialize

I generally think people specialize too soon and have to declare your major, and not having electives is pretty tragic. There really no reason to use words like "majors" to try to dictate what you should and should not know on what you think you it is or is not reputable or easy or hard.

You should take the time in college to just prove your interest and try things out and fail. I know so many people who did three or four internships at the same company like Facebook and Google and I just thought that was the most boring thing you could possibly , what those students go through the program and have the opportunity to six or seven internships and not even diversify a little bit to seem so uninteresteing.

I think a lot of success came from the fact that I did research what did physics or did a start up work with sales people work with researchers went to large companies like Facebook and eventually Wen full-time at Stitchfix.

## Just create your peer group

After the second year of college, I decided I wanted to learn machine, learning and leave physics. I had taken Andrew Ngs machine, learning course on Coursera and blew me away with what was possible. But at the time I didn't know anyone who was interested in machine learning so again, I did what I had done in high school, spring to get ahead. I started a machine learning club. I started it for Hackathon Hackers with Data Hackers, and grew that to 7000 people. I started a data science machine learning club at Waterloo. I started a guide on how to start your own data science / machine learning club, i met the kids who started the clubs around all the north american colleges that were apart of hackathon hackers.

Just like how i built my following on twitter, i read papers, posted summaries. I posted 40 times a week helpful content.

### You only need to be a little bit ahead

I found myself in a situation where hundreds of people messaged me with their machine learning and data science questions, not knowing I was just like them. However, I would diligently search on Google and YouTube to find answers and call them to discuss the topics. Although I was only slightly more knowledgeable than them, having this audience allowed me collect interesting questions and find answers.

Eventually, I started dedicating six hours every Saturday to join Google Meet sessions and converse with strangers on the internet. This helped me learn more about their experiences, answer their queries whenever possible, and learn from their insights.

!!! note "Friends to this day"

    I wouldn't be the person I am today if it weren't for this Facebook Group. I met two dozen Thiel Fellows, founders, 30 Under 30 kids - you name it. The scientists and engineers I met when we were 19 on that group are still my friends to this day. Many of them are now staff or principal-level engineers, investors, founders, and more.

### Keep practicing

By the time I started the Data Science Club, my goal was simply to teach as much as possible. I would give a couple of lengthy lectures every semester and organize career panels. I practiced reviewing résumés to develop a better understanding of how to write my own. Additionally, I honed my interview skills by conducting mock interviews.

Every opportunity to teach, learn, and practice is a chance to improve. Being able to explain something well results in people asking the out of the box questions that you wouldn't have thought of. The goal of teaching is for the audience to collect all the idiosyncratic edge cases of your knowledge and bring them to your attention.
