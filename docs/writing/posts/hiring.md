# Hiring MLEs at early stage companies

!!! note "A voice memo turned essay."

    Most of this is actually a short voice memoir I've recorded. I used opus to convert this to a little bit more of a structured thoughts but I'm open to feedback.

As a consultant, I recognize that my perspective on hiring is influenced by the fact that part-time engagements are often more beneficial for me than full-time roles. With that said, I've observed two notable patterns in the hiring practices of startups. Part of me wonders if this is a leading insecurity of many startups to hire machine learning engineers to bolster their generative AI strengths while making them just do janitorial work for the first six months of joining.

## Machine learning engineers are hired too early in a company's life cycle

Many startups make the mistake of hiring machine learning engineers a bit too early in the development process, especially when the primary focus should have been on app development and integration work. I think a full-stack AI engineer can provide a lot of value at this stage since they're likely to function as a full-stack developer rather than a specialized machine learning engineer. Consequently, these engineers often find themselves assisting with app development or DevOps tasks instead of focusing on their core competencies of training models and building ML solutions.

After all, my background is in mathematics and physics, not engineering. I would rather spend my days looking at data than trying to spend two or three hours debugging TypeScript build errors.

As a data scientist and a machine learning engineer, most of my skills are best suited for a slightly later-stage company when there might already be two dozen engineers deep into building out the product. For me to even consider joining a company at an early stage, I would have to recognize that most of my responsibilities early on will be around digging into the application, which can be seen as a drag. No data, no objectives, no model. If you can consider any of these early-stage companies, I would really have to be sold on a more ambitious, longer-term technical vision and the significance of that problem, needing us to step aside from research. It would have to be so exciting that I would be willing to deal with old errors and studying blogging and all the boring stuff first in order to get to the more exciting meat of the problem. But without the opportunity to focus on research at some point in the near future and drive impact through improving these models, I think machine learning engineers who are really good will likely realize that they're better suited for another role or another company rather than having to flex into traditional machine learning.

## Lack of Dedicated Research Teams Hinders AI Progress

Another pattern I've noticed is that engineering teams have usually successfully developed an impressive demo that gains traction and popularity. But due to the absence of a dedicated team, it results in a lot of significant issues around having highly motivated engineers behind these demos being bogged down by day-to-day engineering tasks, bug fixes, and maintenance alike, ones that are not necessarily AI related.

This is mostly an issue because there's been a lot of folks who have really caught the bug of generative AI. Folks that could go above and beyond to really figure out and understand what it is they want to build, how to build it, and how it could be impactful for the business. Now they find themselves torn between their passions for advancing the AI capabilities and the need to keep the existing core products running smoothly.

Simultaneously, it may be challenging for startups to justify hiring a dedicated machine learning engineer at this stage. Without a clear division between research and engineering tasks, there may not be enough specialized work to warrant a full-time ML engineer, as much of their time would be spent on general engineering responsibilities.

To address this issue, startups should carefully consider the timing of their machine learning hires and ensure that there is sufficient data and infrastructure in place to support their work. On top of that, if we just let these engineers who've caught the AI bug really flourish in developing these teams, they are already extremely familiar with the systems and infrastructure that they could move very quickly, given the tools that OpenAI and Anthropic are providing for us. Having a dedicated research team, even if small, can help maintain the momentum of AI research and development, even as the company scales and faces increased engineering demands.

It's important to recognize that for many companies, the initial AI work will likely focus on integration rather than pure research. However, having team members who are strong developers and genuinely interested in AI will be crucial for the company's long-term success in the field. By finding the right balance between research and engineering, startups can lay the foundation for sustained AI innovation and growth.
