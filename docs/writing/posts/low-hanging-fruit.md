# Low-Hanging Fruit for RAG Search

Reverse search, or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with language generation to provide relevant and accurate responses to user queries. By searching through a large corpus of text and retrieving the most relevant chunks, RAG systems can generate answers that are grounded in factual information.

In this post, we'll explore six key areas where you can focus your efforts to improve your RAG search system. These include using synthetic data for baseline metrics, adding date filters, improving user feedback copy, tracking average cosine distance and Cohere reranking score, incorporating full-text search, and efficiently generating synthetic data for testing.

    I like to give the ideas for free but sell the implementation. If you're interested in getting some help on improving your rag application. Take a look at my [consulting services](../../services.md).

By addressing these low-hanging fruit, you can take your RAG search system to the next level, providing users with more relevant, accurate, and timely information. Let's dive in and explore each of these opportunities in more detail.

## 1. Synthetic Data for Baseline Metrics

Synthetic data can be used to establish baseline precision and recall metrics for your reverse search.

**Benefits:**

1. Identifying complexity and benchmarking performance
2. Identifying weaknesses and guiding improvement efforts
3. Cost-effective testing and reproducibility

## 2. Adding Date Filters

Incorporating date filters into your search system can significantly improve the user experience by providing more relevant and up-to-date information.

**Benefits:**

1. Increased relevance and freshness of search results
2. Improved efficiency in narrowing down results
3. Enabling trend analysis and historical context

## 3. Improving Thumbs Up/Down Copy

Using specific copy for your thumbs up/down buttons, such as "Did we answer your question?" instead of generic phrases, offers several benefits.

**Benefits:**

1. Focused feedback on the relevance and quality of search results
2. Reduced ambiguity in user interpretation
3. Actionable insights for improving the search system

## 4. Tracking Average Cosine Distance and Cohere Reranking Score

Monitoring the average cosine distance and Cohere reranking score for each question can help identify challenging queries and prioritize improvements.

**Benefits:**

1. Identifying strengths and weaknesses of the search system
2. Enabling targeted optimization for specific query types
3. Data-driven decision making for resource allocation and feature prioritization

## 5. Using Full-Text Search

Incorporating both full-text search and semantic search (vector search) can improve the overall performance of your search system.

**Benefits:**

1. Identifying relevant documents based on exact keyword matches
2. Uncovering conceptually similar documents
3. Improving the overall effectiveness of the search system

## 6. Making Text Chunks Look Like Questions

When generating synthetic data for testing your search system, it's more efficient to make text chunks look like questions rather than the other way around.

**Benefits:**

1. Reduced latency compared to generating hypothetical document embeddings
2. More effective testing of the search system's performance
3. Avoiding the overhead of generating embeddings for every possible question variant

By focusing on these low-hanging fruit opportunities, you can significantly enhance the performance and usability of your RAG search system, ultimately providing a better experience for your users.
