# The Future of RAG: Generating Reports to Accelerate Decision Making

## Motivation

Instead of just using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for question answering, which has limited value, the real impact lies in leveraging RAG to automatically generate reports that can accelerate decision making and align teams. People are willing to pay for high-quality reports that provide valuable insights and save time.

## Positioning

This capability should be marketed as a way to "make decisions faster" and "get aligned", rather than merely saving time on simple question answering. The focus should be on the substantial value provided by the generated reports in terms of improved decision making and team coordination.

## Examples

1. **Financial Research Reports**
   - Take financial documents for a company over time and automatically generate reports in the format of Morning Star or other equity research firms
   - Replace time-consuming manual research work
2. **Interview Debriefs**
   - Automatically generate a single comprehensive interview report from multiple interview transcripts
   - Capture key points, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for follow-up
   - Save time and improve alignment in hiring decisions
3. **User Research Synthesis**
   - Distill insights from large volumes of user research interviews into standardized reports
   - Include pros, cons, NPS scores, and other key metrics
   - Quickly identify trends and actionable insights
4. **Personal Data-Driven Form Filling for Applications**
   - Use AI to process an individual's personal data (e.g., emails, documents, social media) and automatically fill out complex forms and applications
   - Similar to how Indexify can generate reports from disparate data sources, AI could analyze personal data to populate fields like work history, skills, interests, etc.
   - Streamline tedious form filling processes and ensure consistency across applications
  
## Mechanics

1. Define standard report templates (e.g., as YAML files) with the desired sections and descriptions
2. Indexify queries the indexed documents to populate the reports
3. Use techniques like automatically extracting question-answer pairs from interview transcripts to improve results

By focusing on the value of generating comprehensive reports and automating complex data extraction tasks, Indexify can differentiate itself from simple RAG question answering. It can deliver substantial benefits to businesses in terms of improved decision making, time savings, and team alignment, while also showcasing the potential for AI to streamline personal data-driven processes like form filling.
