# Chase Bank Small Business Nightmare: A Warning to Entrepreneurs

I never thought I'd be writing a cautionary tale about banking, but here we are. As an AI consultant and small business owner, I assumed my long-standing relationship with Chase Bank would provide a solid foundation for my new venture. I was wrong. Painfully, expensively wrong.

This is the story of how Chase froze $180,000 of my money, left me scrambling to pay employees, and nearly derailed my business—all without explanation. It's also a wake-up call for other entrepreneurs about the importance of diversifying your banking and choosing financial partners that actually support small businesses.

## The Setup: A Decade of Trust

I'd been with Chase since 2014. When I started my LLC last year, opening a business account with them seemed like a no-brainer. Within four months, I had accumulated about $180,000 in that account. Things were going well. Until they weren't.

## The Freeze: No Warning, No Explanation

One day, out of the blue, Chase blocked all transactions and closed my account. They didn't even bother to tell me. I had to call six different customer service agents and get transferred around a dozen times before I realized what had happened. Their response? "We're not going to do business with you." No explanation. No recourse.

!!! note "The Kafka-esque Nightmare Begins"

    Imagine waking up one day to find your entire business locked out of its own funds. No warning, no explanation. Just a wall of silence and bureaucracy. This was my new reality.

## The Runaround: A Global Chase

At the time, I wasn't even living in the U.S. My O-1 visa was still processing, so I couldn't immediately fly back to sort things out. My EA was powerless. No one at Chase would give us any information.

When I finally made it to San Francisco, I hit another wall. They kept asking for more evidence. Prove you own the business. Prove you're a signee. It never ended.

## The New York Saga: AirBnB and Bank Branches

Desperate for resolution, I spent three weeks in New York City, bouncing between Chase branches. I even rented an AirBnB right outside a branch. Why? Because I had $180,000 locked away, and I was running out of options.

Each branch asked for different paperwork—often the same documents I'd already submitted in San Francisco. The story kept changing:

1. "You don't own the business."
2. "Some of your clients aren't from the U.S."
3. "There are suspicious transactions."

But they wouldn't tell me which transactions were suspicious. They wouldn't mail out the money. And my business account? It had vanished from my online banking portal.

## The Breaking Point: Running on Empty

As weeks turned into months, I was burning through my personal savings. I had to borrow money from friends just to keep the business afloat. Payroll was coming out of my personal account, wreaking havoc on my accounting.

    It's not just about the frozen funds. It's the cascading effect on every aspect of your business and personal life. Missed opportunities, strained relationships, and the constant stress of financial uncertainty.

## The Hail Mary: Executives and Twitter

Someone suggested contacting Chase's executive office. My EA found every executive email we could and launched a full-scale outreach campaign. Simultaneously, I turned to Twitter, connecting with peers who put me in touch with different account managers.

Finally, a breakthrough. But Chase's demands were absurd: they wanted the name, address, and phone number of every single person I'd done business with.

## The Resolution: Too Little, Too Late

After months of back-and-forth, multiple simultaneous conversations, and escalation to the executive branch, I finally got my money. But the damage was done. My trust in big banks was shattered.

## The Lessons: What Every Entrepreneur Should Know

1. **Big Banks Aren't Your Friend**: Despite years of loyalty, Chase showed zero consideration for my situation or my business.

2. **Diversify Your Banking**: Never rely on a single bank account for your business. Have backups.

3. **Consider Alternatives**: I've since switched to Mercury Bank. They actually understand and support small businesses.

4. **Have Support**: I was only able to navigate this nightmare because I had an EA. Many small business owners don't have this luxury.

5. **Be Prepared for Anything**: In consulting, especially in tech fields like AI, you need to be ready for curveballs—including from your own bank.

## The Takeaway: Choose Your Financial Partners Wisely

In the world of consulting and small business, it's often feast or famine. Don't let your bank turn your feast into a famine. Be prepared, be diversified, and choose financial partners that understand your business.

Remember, you're not just choosing a place to store your money. You're choosing a partner in your business journey. Make sure it's one that will support you, not sabotage you at the first sign of success.
