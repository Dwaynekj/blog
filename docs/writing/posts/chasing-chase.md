# Why you should avoid Chase Bank as a small business owner

Folks always told me that consulting was a either feast or famine, but I don't know what this was.

I never thought I'd be writing a cautionary tale about banking, but here we are. As an AI consultant and small business owner, I assumed my long-standing personal account with Chase Bank would provide a solid foundation for my new venture. I was wrong. Painfully, expensively wrong.

This is the story of how Chase froze $180,000 of my money, left me scrambling to pay employees, and nearly derailed my business—all without explanation. It's also a wake-up call for other entrepreneurs about the importance of diversifying your banking and choosing financial partners that actually support small businesses.

## The Setup: A Decade of Trust

I'd been with Chase since 2014. When I started my business last year, opening a business account with them seemed like a no-brainer, I was able to do it online while I was in Canada, waiting for my O-1 visa to process. Within four months of consulting, I had accumulated about $180,000 in that account, an amazing accomplishment for a new business. Things were going well. Until they weren't.

## The Freeze: No Warning, No Explanation

One day, out of the blue, Chase blocked all transactions on my account—including payroll for my employees. They didn't even bother to tell me until my payroll provider couldn't process the payment. I had to call six different customer service agents and get transferred around a dozen times before I realized what had happened. Their response? "We're not going to do business with you. We will mail you a cashier's check." No explanation. No recourse. After 4 weeks of waiting, nothing came up in the mail.

!!! note "The Kafka-esque Nightmare Begins"

    Imagine waking up one day to find your entire business locked out of its own funds, unable to pay your employees. No warning, no explanation. Just a wall of silence and bureaucracy. This was my new reality.

## Chasing Chase

At the time, I wasn't even living in the U.S. My O-1 visa was still processing, so I couldn't immediately fly back to sort things out. My EA was powerless as she was not a signee on the account. No one at Chase would give us any information!

When finally got cleared to travel, I finally made it to San Francisco, I hit another wall. They kept asking for more evidence. Prove you own the business. Prove you're a signee. It never ended. After emailing the branch manager every document attributed to my LLC formation, I finally got a response. They told me once they retrieve and verify the documents, they'd mail me a cashier's check. When I left San Francisco and went back to Canada, again, no check.

Desperate for resolution, I fly back to New York City, bouncing between Chase branches. I even rented an AirBnB right outside a branch. Why? Because I had $180,000 locked away, and I was running out of options.



1. "You don't own the business."
2. "Some of your clients aren't from the U.S."
3. "There are suspicious transactions."

But they wouldn't tell me which transactions were suspicious. They wouldn't mail out the money. And my business account? It had vanished from my online banking portal. By that time I had depleted my personal checking account, and was running on credit cards that I would have to sell stocks from to pay my employees.

As weeks turned into months, I was burning through my personal savings. I had to borrow money from friends just to keep the business afloat. Payroll was coming out of my personal account, wreaking havoc on my accounting. 

## The Silver Lining: Mercury Bank to the Rescue

In the midst of this nightmare, I was quickly onboarded to [Mercury Bank](https://app.mercury.com/r/567). They were a breath of fresh air compared to Chase. Mercury allowed me to create both personal and business accounts quickly and efficiently. They asked for all necessary paperwork upfront, ensuring a smooth onboarding process. Their understanding of small business needs and proactive approach to compliance was exactly what I needed after the Chase ordeal. 


## The Hail Mary: Executives and Twitter

Ssomeone suggested contacting Chase's executive office. My EA found every executive email we could and launched a little outreach campaign. Simultaneously, I turned to Twitter, connecting with peers who put me in touch with different account managers.

Finally, a breakthrough. But Chase's demands were absurd: Each branch asked for different paperwork—often the same documents I'd already submitted in San Francisco. The demands kept escalating: they wanted the name, address, and phone number of every single person who had sent me money, including Buy Me a Coffee supporters and GitHub sponsors. The story kept changing. Luckily, I had an EA who could help me do this. Otherwise, I would have definitely been underwater given the various workshops, speaking engagements, client work, and research I had due in the upcoming months.

## The Resolution: Too Little, Too Late

After months of back-and-forth, multiple simultaneous conversations, and escalation to the executive branch, I finally got my money. It wasn't the $25,000 stripe transfer, or business ownership, I never knew that ended up being the actual issue. After 2 weeks working with the Executive team, I finally got my money.But the damage was done. My trust was shattered.


## The Lessons: What Every Entrepreneur Should Know

1. **Big Banks Aren't Your Friend**: Despite years of loyalty, Chase showed zero consideration for my situation or my business. I now know why so many startups and small businesses are trying to innovate in banking.

2. **Diversify Your Banking**: Never rely on a single bank account for your business. Have backups. I now have Mercury Bank, and soon will be diversifying my banking with Meow.

3. **Consider Alternatives**: Switching to Mercury Bank was a game-changer. They actually understand and support small businesses.

4. **Have Support**: I was only able to navigate this nightmare because I had an American EA who was incredibly helpful and had the context of my business.

5. **Be Prepared for Anything**: In consulting, especially in tech fields like AI, you need to be ready for curveballs—including from your own bank.

Remember, you're not just choosing a place to store your money. You're choosing a partner in your business journey. Make sure it's one that will support you, not sabotage you at the first sign of success.
