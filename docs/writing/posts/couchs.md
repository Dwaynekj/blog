# A Critique on Couches

I've been thinking about this problem for seven years. Of how much I've disliked couch. Ever since I left home and lived in my own spaces, the thought of a couch was always one of oppression.

In this piece I'm going to outline some of the reasons I think couches are kind of an oppressive poison, I'm going to tackle it from a couple of different lenses, believe them as fragments of thoughts. Feel free to read these paragraphs in any order that interests you.

The couch, often oriented towards a television, represents a societal imposition of a predetermined essence on our living spaces. This setup, reflecting Sartre's concept of bad faith, dictates the room's function, limiting its potential. It echoes the limitations we impose on ourselves when conforming to societal expectations, neglecting our authentic selves.

## Directing the Gaze

I've always thought of chairs and benches at parks and windows as a way of framing the world that we see. Looking out the window you can see the moon or the shadows of leaves flickering into your room. A place to sit is a place to direct the gaze. We might sip our coffees and look at the streets or sit at a park bench and appreciate the world in front of us.

Now consider the couch in a "living room". For a couch to be in any living room, it is hardly for living. It's not something that we point out to the window, into the backyard, onto a lake. In most American homes, the couch directs our gaze to a wall or a television. It dictates the purpose of a room to be one where we're supposed to sit down and consuming. I couldn't count the number of times I've been to someone's house and sat at two ends uncomfortably contorting our bodies looking at each other.

Sartre’s concept of "the Look" is critical in understanding self-awareness and otherness. The typical living room setup, where seating faces away from each other, averts the direct engagement of the gaze, fostering a detached form of social interaction. This arrangement promotes a superficial existence, avoiding the existential anxiety of being an object in another’s world.

## House parties are in the kitchen

For a living room with a couch, it's a perfect place to go and watch a movie or a sports game. Consumption. But if you were to maximize the number of human connections, It's no wonder that so many people end up just standing because nobody wants to sit down on this sacred space with room for three. It ends up just being a glorified coat rack. To actually sit on the couch is to almost choose to exclude yourself from the conversation of 'standing people'

## Sacred Space

One other issue with the couch is that it puts some rules and constraints on how closely people sit to each other. Creating some rules on distance that I find very strange. If everyone will see it on the floor, there's not some presupposed distance. Whether I was a foot away from you or a meter away, it wouldn't really matter. The entire surface is yours to take up.

So when you sit on a couch with limited space, it makes sense to sit on the ends. Segmenting at the space forces us to produce some kind of minimum distance. In such a way that to sit closer to someone would be strange and unexpected. But then, as you introduce more than two people on a space, the conversation gets strange as one can speak over the other as some poor soul is stuck in the middle. If theres 4 people, the dynamics are jsut as silly. The two people on the ends are forced to turn their heads to the middle to speak to the other two. It's a strange dynamic that I've never really understood.

## Limited Transcedence

The counter is such a large and immobile piece of furniture that it is very hard to have a living room that can transcend multiple utilities. It's a symbol that denies the room of other possibilities. With unlimited space, a large couch dictates the only place that you can "be". Whereas if we had an open space, we could do so much more. We could sit in a circle and tell stories. We can lay down some mats and do yoga. It could be a dance party, it could be a restaurant, it could be so much more.

This approach can indeed foster intimacy and interaction, as it encourages people to engage more closely and directly with each other. It also challenges the conventional notion of a living room as primarily a space for passive consumption, typically oriented towards a television.

## Sitting is just Bad

Some people criticize my thoughts on the basis that it is important to be able to sit somewhere comfortably for three hours. I'm honestly just not convinced that that's a feature. I just don't believe we should be seated for that long. When I set in the floor or in a bean bag that can arrange in any place in my house that I choose, it's still very easy to set for a room. is still very easy to set for a long time. When I sit on the floor, there's a level of discomfort that forces me to shift my weight and adjust myself. And in turn actually move. I think that's a good thing.

There's so much research that shows that just sitting in general has been terrible on our hips and our hip flexors. We all of a sudden get so lazy and relaxed that we lose the ability to strengthen our own spines.

A study by Columbia University Irving Medical Center found that taking a five-minute stroll every half hour can offset the harmful effects of prolonged sitting. This simple activity can significantly improve cardiometabolic risk factors.

## The benefits of rissing from the floor

The research linking the ability to rise from the floor to mortality risk was published in the "European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention" by Claudio Gil Araújo and colleagues. The study introduced the 'sitting-rising test' (SRT), assessing the ease of getting up from and down to the floor. It found a significant correlation between SRT scores and mortality risk, suggesting that lower scores were associated with higher mortality risk. This was due to SRT's ability to measure muscular strength, flexibility, and balance, key indicators of general health and longevity.

If that's not actually the case, why don't we just sit on the floor to begin with and just develop these motor skills as we age? I bet there's so many Americans who would struggle to just go from seated to standing. People who can't put weight on their hands or are too immobile.

## "Well, I want to lay down"

I'm not suggesting you sit on, like, cold marble. Having a combination of a rug or a mat with some bean bags means that not only can you lay down, Since the floor is not this sacred space where we put our dirty shoes, we should be able to lay down in any orientation in any direction.

There's literally more space.

## Consider the Tatami room

Consider the tatami room. A room that is designed to be a multi-purpose space. A room that can be used for tea ceremonies, for sleeping, for eating, for socializing. We can have very modular lightweight furniture be moved in to eat on a table. Arrange mats to sit in a circle for us to all be able to talk to each other.

We can roll up futons and put them in the closet. And when we're ready, we can also go to bed and sleep.
