# Purity Olympics: Your Life is Not a Challenge Run

Here's the biggest lesson I learned about business and life through Elden Ring: Most of us are unknowingly playing challenge runs, and complaining about it.

If you've ever watched Elden Ring or played the game, you'll notice something fascinating: there are countless ways to play. You can use summons, magic, or focus on dexterity builds. But scroll through the comments, and you'll find an endless purity contest:

"Oh, you use summons? That's cheap." "Magic? Real players don't use magic." "A true gamer beats it with melee, learn to dodge and parry."

But here's the kicker – while these "purists" are arguing about the "right" way to play, there's someone out there beating the entire game with DDR dance pads or Donkey Kong bongos. And those absolute legends? They're not the ones judging how others play. They're just happy people are enjoying the game.

Another example where I see this is in jiu-jitsu, where someone might say "Wow, you're really strong" as a backhanded compliment. The implication is that using strength is somehow less pure or technical. But here's the thing - you too can get stronger. It's not cheating; it's just another tool in your arsenal.

## The Challenge Run Mindset

When someone decides to beat Elden Ring without magic or summons, they're doing what's called a "challenge run" – intentionally making the game harder for themselves. Its not about purity, its just a challenge run, and thats ok, some people have beaten the whole dark souls series with a ddr pad too.

But recently, I've realized I've been doing challenge runs in my own life without even knowing it.

Some examples from my journey:

- Starting a business with an empty bank account
- Avoiding mentors and trying to figure everything out alone
- Refusing to delegate and doing everything myself
- Marketing without professional help or guidance

This mindset goes way back for me. Growing up poor, I'd play Pokemon with a scarcity mentality – never using valuable items like Master Balls or potions because "I might need them later." I'd finish the game with a full inventory of unused items, having made everything needlessly harder for myself.

Sound familiar? It's like:

- Refusing to spend $20 on software and instead spending two weeks building it yourself
- Not investing in marketing because you believe "good work speaks for itself"
- Avoiding networking because you want to "make it on pure merit"

## The Unintentional Hard Mode

Here's the truth: You can beat Elden Ring with a strength build, and yes, it might be "purer" in some people's eyes. But why make things harder if that's not what you actually want?

The real problem isn't playing on hard mode – it's doing it unconsciously and then complaining about how difficult everything is.

- Oh well they have rich parents
- Oh they are just hot
- Oh well... well... they... have good genetics

## Choosing Your Constraints

Look, there's nothing inherently wrong with self-imposed limitations. I run my business without venture capital or hired any staff thats not just supporting me - but I consciously chose these constraints. They align with my values and goals. The problem isn't having limitations; it's not realizing you're imposing them on yourself.

Ask yourself:

- What "challenge runs" am I currently doing for no reason?
- Did I consciously choose these limitations?
- Do these constraints align with my values and goals?
- Which limitations am I carrying unconsciously from past experiences?

The key difference between a strategic choice and a self-imposed barrier is awareness. When you're conscious of your choices, you can adapt them as needed. When you're not, they control you.

## The Way Forward

Life is really fucking hard already, we don't need to add artificial contraints unless its just fun for you. But i'd honestly challenge you to ask yourself:

- Am I making this harder than it needs to be?
- What "summons" or "power-ups" am I refusing to use?
- Is there pride or fear behind my self-imposed limitations?

In Elden Ring, the game designers made all of of these tools available to you, its not cheap or cheating, the real pros know this. They're not worried about looking pure; they're focused on winning or just having fun.
