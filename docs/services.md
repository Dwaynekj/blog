# Applied AI Consulting Services

I aim to empower you to launch AI products with confidence and precision, swiftly navigating past the AI hype to secure a dream outcome: more users, superior data quality, and enhanced product development. This approach not only elevates your team but also optimizes time and effort, paving the way for success.

I'm not your typical consultant. For better or for worse, I've been in the trenches more than I'd like, and my goal is to help you minimize regret by sharing my lessons with you and giving you a clear vision on what to invest in and what to build.

!!! note "More Background"

    - Led feasibility research and integrated AI models like VAE-GAN and GPT-3, boosting revenue by $50M.

    - Oversaw a $400,000 budget for impactful AI data curation.

    - Over three years, I spearheaded the creation of a robust recommendation [framework](./writing/posts/recsys-frameworks.md) and observability tools, handling 350 million daily requests.

    Throughout my career in the tech industry, I've had the privilege of working with both established organizations such as [Stitchfix](https://www.stitchfix.com/), [Meta](https://about.fb.com/), and [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/), as well as startups including [Rewind AI](https://rewind.ai/), [Naro](https://narohq.com/), [Trunk Tools](https://trunktools.com/), [New Computer](https://newcomputer.io/), [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

    In these collaborations, I've tackled diverse areas including personalization, search, data generation and management, sales, marketing, infrastructure, finance, and agent-based modeling.

## What do I do?

My expertise includes retrieval-augmented generation, query understanding, prompt engineering, embedding finetuning, and MLOps observability.

!!! question "What does working with me look like?"

    Here are some kinds of projects I can help with:

    * **Auditing**: Identify gaps in your AI strategy and for example, improving [RAG applications](./writing/posts/levels-of-rag.md) and query understanding.
    * **Product Vision**: Work together to align your product vision with company goals and set up successful data engineering practices.
    * **Launch**: Ensure [observability](./writing/posts/llmops.md) during launch to collect essential data for a strong data strategy.
    * **Coaching**: Enhance team performance with goal setting, metric definition, and skills development.
    * **Prompt Prototyping**: Develop custom prompts and extraction pipelines and evaluations.

    Make these decisions with someone who's done it before.  Shoot me an [email](mailto:jason+hire@jxnl.co) about what problems you're facing and we can set up a time to chat.
