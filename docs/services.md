# AI Consulting for Engineering Leaders

## I work with engineering leaders like you who:

* **Need Solutions for Multimedia AI usecases** - Maybe you know quite familiar with RAG and LLMs for textual data, but do you need help grappling with other modalities like images, video, vector, 3D? I can help you plan your product strategy for search and retrival, generation, data collection, presentation, performant inference

* **Struggle to evaluate AI performance** - Do you need help establishing measures of how well your generated media will perform for your business outcomes. I can help you design meaningful metrics that ease your automation burden

* **Need a Crash Courses** - Do you need help getting a grasp on the plethora of available tools and approaches. I can help you navigate the litany of options

* **Lack AI expertise on their team** - Do you need access to someone who has been embedded in teams in organizations new to integrating AI products? Do you want to have your team cross-trained in AI? I can help with that

* **Need To Grow an AI Team Fast** - I help plan and conduct interviews for ML, AI, Data, MLOPs, DevOPs, Infrastructure Engineers of varying levels
