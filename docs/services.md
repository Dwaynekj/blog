# Build AI Products Your Customers Trust

If you're an engineering leader at a startup looking to roll out AI to production, I can help. Over the last decade, I’ve guided 20+ engineering teams—like those at HubSpot, Zapier, and others—through the challenges of AI product development. I focus on what actually works: simple baselines, straightforward systems, and business outcomes over hype.

My expertise includes:

- Training teams transitioning to probabilistic or AI-powered systems  
- Pivoting existing products into AI-enabled solutions that generate valuable data  
- Hiring and assessing top-tier AI engineering talent

If I don’t have the answer, I’ll tap my network of trusted experts to find it. My approach is practical, measurable, and focused on long-term impact.

## How I Work with Your Team

**First Look at Your Team:**  
I embed directly with your team—joining standups, reviewing workflows, and identifying hidden bottlenecks. Often, we find no one is using real metrics to track performance.

**Make it Scientific:**  
We replace “it feels better” with “it’s 20% faster.” Decisions become data-driven, measurable, and focused on outcomes.

**Accelerate Testing:**  
Your team might take days for a test that should take minutes. We identify friction, fix it, and make iterative experimentation your new normal.

**User-Driven Feedback:**  
We implement easy feedback loops, so you know what users dislike and why. Then we fix the highest-impact issues first.

**Cultural Transformation:**  
Over time, your team evolves to rely on facts instead of intuition. Each week, user feedback turns into targeted experiments. Results are clear, improvements are constant.

**Growth & Hand-Off:**  
Once the system is stable, I help find long-term leaders suited to this new, data-driven culture. Then, I step back into an advisory role—available to course correct if needed, but confident you can run the show independently.

## My Background: Turning Setback into Strength

I honed my AI skills at Stitch Fix, working on vision models, data labeling, generative modeling, and multimodal embeddings. The question was always: how do we go from “this model works” to “how do we make money from it and build a real product?”

Later, I developed severe RSI in my hands, ending my ability to code full-time. What seemed like a career-ending setback led me to refocus on strategy, measurement, and coaching teams to build trustworthy AI without guesswork. Now, companies like HubSpot and Zapier rely on me to steer their teams toward reliable, customer-loved AI products.

**If your main challenge is building or improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, consider my dedicated RAG course.** It’s a structured, proven program for refining RAG applications end-to-end. [Learn more here.](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md)

## Minimize Regret, Maximize Results

I’ve seen countless companies waste months and millions. I can’t promise product-market fit or guaranteed success, but I can promise:

- A clear, measurable plan  
- Rapid, simple experimentation cycles  
- A relentless focus on what matters most

My job is to show you when the “easy” is actually hard and when the “hard” might be easier than you think. It’s about minimizing regret and making every investment count.
