# Applied AI Consulting Services

You can hire me by sending an [email](mailto:jason+hire@jxnl.co) about what your team is looking for.

---

I'm not your typical consultant. For better or for worse, I've been in the trenches more than I'd like, and my goal is to help you minimize regret by sharing my lessons with you and giving you a clear vision on what to invest in and what to build.

I've spearheaded work in applying new AI algorithms at Stitchfix from 2018-2023, increasing revenue by $50M, managed a $400,000 data curation budget, and developed high-capacity recommendation frameworks which improved personalization and observability of our overall infrastructure.

__I've been using multimodal embeddings for search and personalization since 2016...__

??? note "More Background"

    - Boosted annual revenue by $50M through leading the feasibility research and integration of state-of-the-art models at the time, such as VAE-GAN, ResNets, YOLO, and GPT-3 into our systems. LLMs are no different.

    - Managed a $400,000 budget for data collection and curation, training labelers, and developing datasets for various AI applications. If current models are the same as in the past, then data is the only thing that can change the game.

    - In three years, I led the development of a comprehensive recommendation [framework](./writing/posts/recsys-frameworks.md) and observability tools, processing over 350 million daily requests. I have expertise in designing key metrics and dashboards to keep your models performant and drift-free.

    Throughout my career in the tech industry, I've had the privilege of working with both established organizations such as [Stitchfix](https://www.stitchfix.com/), [Meta](https://about.fb.com/), and [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/), as well as startups including [Rewind AI](https://rewind.ai/), [Naro](https://narohq.com/), [Trunk Tools](https://trunktools.com/), [New Computer](https://newcomputer.io/), [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

    In these collaborations, I've tackled diverse areas including personalization, search, data generation and management, sales, marketing, infrastructure, finance, and agent-based modeling.

## What do I do?

I provide consulting and advisory work for VCs and fast-growing startups interested in applying machine learning and AI. If you want to learn more about my work, you can browse my [resume](https://jxnl.co/) or [email](mailto:jason+hire@jxnl.co) me.

!!! question "What does working with me look like?"

    Here are some kinds of projects I can help with:

    * **Auditing**: Bring your team, and I'll assist in pinpointing the [gaps](./writing/posts/rag-inverted.md) in your AI roadmap and development process. Currently focusing on [RAG applications](./writing/posts/levels-of-rag.md) around evaluations and [query understanding](./writing/posts/rag.md).
    * **Product Vision**: Collaborate to create a product vision that aligns with your company's goals. Defining how to design the data flywheel and set your data engineering up for success.
    * **Launch**: As you're [launching](./writing/posts/mvp.md), establish [observability](./writing/posts/llmops.md), setting you on the path to amass the right data for a robust data flywheel.
    * **Coaching**: Offer guidance to elevate your team's performance. Like [defining metrics](./writing/posts/lgtmk.md), goal setting, and tips on developing [probabilistic software](./writing/posts/stochastic-software.md).
    * **Prompt Prototyping**: Collaborate to create prototype prompt and extraction pipelines tailored to your needs using Python tooling like [instructor](jxnl.github.io/instructor), FastAPI, or even embedding fine-tuning.

    Make these decisions with someone who's done it before.  Shoot me an [email](mailto:jason+hire@jxnl.co) about what problems you're facing and we can set up a time to chat.

## What do I offer?

I offer two types of services, depending on your needs:

### 1. Strategic Consulting

I will help you cut through the bloat of implementing an AI strategy to improve your team's productivity and, in turn, help you grow revenue and increase market cap.

#### Here’s what you get:
- **Asynchronous Access & Strategic Guidance:** Anytime access for advice and strategic guidance to prioritize and overcome obstacles, fostering open communication without hourly constraints.
- **Problem-Solving & Scaling:** Coaching for team growth and scientific thinking in AI/ML, aimed at making your engineering processes more efficient and quantified.
- **Access to Experts:** Leverage my network to connect with specialists in computer vision, LLM fine-tuning, investing, and more, to build your business connections.
- **Partnership & Framework Development:** Building a long-term partnership with follow-on project customization and providing a structured framework for best practices in AI/ML development.

### 2. Comprehensive Consulting

I work hands-on with your team to help them improve their AI capabilities. This option is perfect for engineering teams looking to accelerate their AI development process, evaluate new technologies, improve their AI capabilities, and train their engineers to think about AI more strategically.

#### Tier 1: Research and Prototyping

In addition to everything mentioned in strategic consulting, you receive:

- **Ad Hoc Research & Proof of Concept:** Conduct feasibility studies on AI/ML challenges, assisting in developing initial prototypes, including prompts, retrieval systems, and data workflows.
- **Data Flywheel Development:** Support in creating a product with the necessary tools for continuous improvement post-launch.
- **Production Implementation:** Collaborate with the engineering team to transition projects from development to production.
- **Optimization Strategies:** Offer comprehensive strategies to enhance data processes, focusing on collection, labeling, and quality for a robust data flywheel.

#### Tier 2: Growth

This is great if you have a specific challenge that you need help with, or if you want to improve your team's AI capabilities.

In addition to the above, you receive:

- **Team Development:** I’ll help level up your team, introduce them to the latest AI techniques and best practices, and even assist in hiring and recruiting top talent.
- **Mentorship:** From improving query systems to establishing effective metrics, I’ll work closely either on a team or one-on-one basis to enhance your engineer’s AI capabilities.
- **Technical Writing & Ad Hoc R&D:** Produce written documents communicating decisions, methodologies, and technical blogs to improve lead generation.

### Pricing
