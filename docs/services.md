## AI systems falling short?

Are you facing these issues?

- **Inconsistent Performance**: Your AI systems lack an data flywheel, leading to unpredictable results without a clear path to improvement.
- **Team Skill Gaps**: Your team struggles to keep up with AI technologies and practices.
- **Scaling Difficulties**: You can't grow your AI capabilities while maintaining quality.

## Imagine if...

- You had a playbook for improving your AI systems over time.

- You could scale your AI initiatives, integrating practices that grow with your needs.

I have worked with leading companies on AI products such as [Limitless AI](http://limitless.ai/), [Sandbar](https://sandbar.inc/), [Raycast](https://raycast.com/), [Tensorlake](https://tensorlake.ai/), [Dunbar](https://trydunbar.com/), [Bytebot](https://bytebot.ai/), [Naro](http://narohq.com/), [Trunk Tools](https://trunktools.com/), [New Computer](http://new.computer/), [Kay.ai](http://kay.ai/), [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), [Pydantic](http://pydantic.dev/), and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) to do just this.
