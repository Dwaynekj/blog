# Applied AI Consulting Services 

You can hire me by sending a _brief_ [email](mailto:jason+hire@jxnl.co) about what your team is looking for.

## My Background

Prior to my sabbatical, I was a Staff ML engineer and tech lead at Stitchfix, spearheading both the AI Algorithms Team and Direct to Consumer e-commerce initiatives, significantly aiding in technology adoption.

- Spearheaded the integration of cutting-edge models like VAE-GAN, Resnets, YOLO, GPT3 into business solutions, boosting retrieval and recommendation systems. This effort led to an annual revenue increase of $50M.

- Oversaw data collection and curation, training data labelers across skill levels and building proprietary datasets for multimodal understanding, covering outfit models, search, recommendations, AI labeling, and ad creation, with a $400,000 budget.

- Engineered a recommendation [framework](./writing/posts/recsys-frameworks.md) and observability tools capable of processing over 350 million daily requests.

- Created a framework for technology partner due diligence, focusing on incremental performance and data access improvements, guiding the adoption of impactful technologies.

Throughout my career in the tech industry, I've had the privilege of working with both established organizations such as [Stitchfix](https://www.stitchfix.com/), [Meta](https://about.fb.com/), and [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/), as well startups including [Rewind AI](https://rewind.ai/), [Naro](https://narohq.com/), [Trunk Tools](https://trunktools.com/), [New Computer](https://newcomputer.io/), [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

In these collaborations, I've tackled diverse areas including personalization, search, data generation and management, sales, marketing, infrastructure, finance, and agent-based modeling.
