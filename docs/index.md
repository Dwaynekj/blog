# You Made it!

I'm an machine learning engineer, [startup advisor](./services.md), and mentor to those entering the software field. I write about tech careers and how to practically apply opensource AI for visual mediums like video generation, virtual try on (VITON), generating synthetic data, 3D asset generation. The research I specialize in is Multimodal Computer Vision and Inverse Graphics.

From a practical perspective, I've led engineering teams, grown teams, brought AI products to market and scaled AI products. I've also mentored hundreds of budding software engineers as they prepared for technical interviews and new careers

## Advising Startups

I help startups interested in using AI to generate more than just pretty images. There is much more you can do with diffusion models and related for practical purposes like synthetic data, graphic design templates, promotional videos, asset creation, etc. Here are some organizations I have done AI research for and/or advised in the past. The majority are focused on multimedia (images, vector-art, video, 3D)
