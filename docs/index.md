# :boom: What's up?

I'm an [independent consultant](./services.md), staff-level machine learning engineer, angel investor, startup advisor, and a16z scout. I write about open source, consulting, and how to systematically improve AI applications.

I'm also the creator of [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/), a popular Python library for structured outputs from LLMs, which was cited by the OpenAI team as inspiration for their `structured output` feature. We currently have over 8000 stars and 1M monthly downloads.

## Independent Consulting

I run a solo consulting practice focused on helping startups build better practises as many software companies transition to AI.
