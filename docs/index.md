# :boom: whats up?

I am a machine learning engineer, angel investor, and startup advisor. I am the creator of [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor), [Flight](./writing/posts/recsys-frameworks.md), and an ML and data science educator, and working writing projects as part of [applied-llms.org](https://applied-llms.org/)

## Get in touch

Do you need help operationalizing ML or large language models? Iâ€™m open to new [consulting work](./services.md) and other forms of advisory. My clients include fast-growing startups backed by firms like Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Accel. If you need help with your project, send me a brief email at `work@jxnl.co`, or we can jump on a [call](https://cal.com/jasonliu/expert-call).

## Subscribe to my writing

I write about a mix of consulting, open source, personal work, and applying llms. I won't email you more than twice a month, not every post I write is worth sharing but I'll do my best to share the most interesting stuff including my own writing, thoughts, and experiences.
